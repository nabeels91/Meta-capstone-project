# About the Data

Global Super Store(GSS) store data about the orders which have been made by customers. There's information is on a wide xlsx sheet and is a very basic way of storing information making it hard to benefit from their stored info. 

All those information is stored in ONLY ONE dataset. This makes the data difficult to monitor, analyze, and extract insights! Therefore we need a structured database to store all those information in a simple and easy-to-monitor format.
